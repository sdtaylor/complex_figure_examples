Klingbeil, B.T., Cohen, J.B., Correll, M.D. et al. High uncertainty over the future of tidal marsh birds under current sea-level rise projections. Biodivers Conserv (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-020-02098-z

## Notes

This is a clever use of transparent columns to fill in the complete 100% of area for the bar plots and provide a nice guide for the eye.

Note how the data is organized. Every unique bar value has a line of data which is labeled with the bird, and model type (green/grey). Birds are the x-axis values while the model type (green/grey) is separated with `position_dodge()`.
