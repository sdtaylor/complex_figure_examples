Figure 1

## Notes

Each of the 5 subplots in this figure are relatively easy to make on their own. The hardest part here was getting them to align correctly using several calls to `cowplow::plot_grid()`. It took many iterations making small adjustments across all the different `rel_width`,`rel_height`,and `scale` arguments to get it just right.
