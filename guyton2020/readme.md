Figure 3

## Notes

The animals are not entirely correct. An important aspect here was filling in missing values for each animal so that spacing on the x-axis is done correctly. Placement of animal silhouettes required fine tuning of each one using x,y arguments in `cowplot::draw_image()`. Also note  how the primary bar graphs have their `height` adjusted down slightly to make room for the silhouettes.
