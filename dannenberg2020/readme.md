Figure 4

## Notes
The authors provided the raster dataset for this figure which made  it pretty simple. The bicolor map is a really clever way to present it (see [this study](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-5-245-2012) for research into it), but it was not trivial to do. 

The hardest part was actually the pie chart since there is not native way to label around the edge like in the original figure. If you're looking to create something similar please just use a barchart.
