Figure 5

## Notes

This uses two base figures. One for the scatterplot and one for the barcharts. The scatter plot uses facet_wrap, but all the row, column, and axis titles are inserted manually using `cowplot::draw_plot() + geom_text()`. facet_wrap does not have a way to insert text like this outside the normal facet_wrap strip labels.
