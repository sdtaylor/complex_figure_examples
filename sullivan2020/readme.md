## Paper
Sullivan et al. 2020. Long-term thermal sensitivity of Earthâ€™s tropical forests. Science. 368:6493, 869-874. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw7578

Figure 1

## Notes
A good example of:  

- When you have multiple plots with exactly the same style, setting up a function to create them instead of doing each one individually.   
- Nice map using the `sf` package.  
- Superscript and potentially other math equations in the axis label.
