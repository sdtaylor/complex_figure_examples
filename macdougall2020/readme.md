## Paper
MacDougall, Andrew H., et al. "Is there warming in the pipeline? A multi-model analysis of the zero emission commitment from CO2." Biogeosciences Discussions (2020): 1-45. https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2987-2020

Figure 7

## Notes  
- positioning of the lower error bars needs to be done manually, since they can't be combined with the "stacking" of the bar plots.  
- getting the stacking order and color assignments correct is a bit finicky.  
- the x-axis order is specified not alphabetically, but by increasing ZEC value.
