Figure 1

## Notes

This figure has 4 panels which share the same x-axis variable, but have different y-axis variables. There are two ways to go about this and both are presented in the example script.  
1) create 4 different panels and combine them using a special library (here using patchwork, but can also be done with cowplot)  
2) use `facet_wrap`, where the facet labels become the y-axis titles.
